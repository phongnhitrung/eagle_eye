1. Full Packet Capture: 
- Lossless capture 10Gbps traffic and store in industry-standard PCAP format.


- Unlimited size of captured file (capture as much as the storage solution can hold)

- Automatically purging out-of-date captured files when the disk reaches threshold usage

2. Detect well-known attack by rule-driven NIDS:

- Detect exactly events of known malicious, anomalous or otherwise suspicious traffic based on rich rule set which covers most of critical security cases

- Automaticaly update rules for newest security cases from trursted and experienced sources

3. Detect 0-day attack by analysis-driven NIDS 

- Using DPI to extract asset, session, transaction data of all activities in networks. This data will be used to reconstruct context of activities to find out 0-day attack

- Discover of over 3000 applications in home, office, industrial control network enviroments: Web services, VoIP, Instant message and chat, gaming, streaming, mobile, file transferring, remote access, industrial control protocols. 

- Automatically capture files as they pass through your network and automatically pass them to a sandbox or a file share for antivirus scanning

4. Powerful analysis framework

- Alert continuously and impressively of events on dashboard 

- Fastly and easily pivot from an alert to its context (pcap files, extracted files, flow and session information ...) with powerful analysis tools

- Query all captured packets to correlate traffic that may not have triggered any alerts but still could be associated with malicious or undesired activity  

- Optimize the time for analyzing by a suite of convinient tools: reverse DNS and whois lookups of IP by Sguil; geo-IP mapping by Squert; visualize in charts, tables, maps by Kibana
